# Intergalactics and Gastronomy: Delicious Defense!!
A charming Tower Defense level about feeding your foes.

You and your cosmic buddies have been cooking up a storm on earth, and it seems you’ve attracted some strange pests who are eager to get a taste of your out-of-this-world cuisine! However, there are some things you just aren’t willing to share. You absolutely must protect your prized donuts from these alien appetites!! Team up with your friends to fend off these intergalactic gluttons and keep their greedy maws away from your favorite donuts. These space invaders won't know what hit them when you launch your delicious defenses into orbit! 

Made with Phaser 3 and Tiled by Anais Montes as a final for CMPM 120 at UCSC
